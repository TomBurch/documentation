<!--
    Welcome to editing the ARCOMM Mission Testing Checklist!
    Unfortunately, as you'll soon notice, this is a bit of a mess.
    As this document is used in Arma, there are some severe limitations
    on the HTML used. You can read about it here:
    https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/HTML_File_Format
    One of those limitations, is that you cannot use indentation,
    as Arma does not trim whitespace, so make sure to shave that
    before saving new versions. Most styling options don't apply
    in arma, so do all website styling in CSS/JS, and arma styling
    in HTML.

<h1>ARCOMM Mission Testing</h1>

<h4>Checklist &amp; Procedures (09/11/2021)</h4>

<h3>Usage of Notes</h3>

<p>
Notes on ARCHUB are there to provide the mission maker with feedback and any clarification that needs to be made
between the maker and the tester. Tester should provide clear and concise feedback and the maker should provide a
changelog for each update and respond to each of the points given by the tester.
<br /><br />
<b>Must</b> means that the given requirement needs to happen.
<br />
<b>Should</b> means that the given requirement is open to adjustment based on mission design.
<br />
</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
• TMF Autotest must be examined before exporting the mission
<br />
<ul>
<li>
- Any warnings must be acknowledged
</li>
<br />
<li>
- Any errors must be resolved
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Add an admin briefing for future replayability containing mission intent and/or hidden tasks/equipment.
<br />
<ul>
<li>
- You can also use editor comments or ARCHUB notes. If you leave a mission undocumented it may be returned
straight away by a tester.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>
• If using known elements make sure to rename <b>BLUFOR</b>/<b>OPFOR</b>/<b>INDFOR</b> to appropriate force names for example
<b>NATO</b>/<b>RUS</b>/<b>VDV</b>, if using unknown elements then clear the <b>BLUFOR</b>/<b>OPFOR</b>/<b>INDFOR</b> designations
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Save file naming convention is as follows: <b>ARC_coop</b>/<b>tvt</b>/<b>ade_nameofmission_yourname</b>. Where <b>coop</b>/<b>tvt</b>/<b>ade</b> is
relevant to mission type, and <b>nameofmission</b> needs to match the name of your operation for loading clarity.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• If the mission includes special slotting orders or instructions, it must be noted in the MP Mission Summary.
Examples:
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- <b>DESCRIPTION HERE | Slotting: CO, Alpha SL/1/2, MAT1, Bravo SL/1/2, MAT2, etc</b>
</li>
<br />
<li>
- <b>DESCRIPTION HERE | Standard slotting, MAT required, overflow to MMG</b>
</li>
<br />
<li>
- <b>DESCRIPTION HERE | Standard slotting | OPF 2:1 BLU</b>
</li>
<br />
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Units and AI</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
• Headless client and Zeus slots must be present (even in adversarial missions).
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Cooperative missions must have pre-placed AI.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• <b>AI Count must not exceed 200</b>. This is a server limitation, and <b>should ideally be kept around 100-150</b>. This can
be found by TMF autotest, or using the TMF Admin menu.
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- Can be higher with aggressive wavespawners and dynamic simulation, though at no time should more than 200 be
active.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Enable and set up dynamic simulation for static units if comfortable with it. This can help relieve server
stress, but is not a solution to the AI limit.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• AI units must not be labeled as players (name will be red in colour).
</li>
<br />
<li>
• All units must be at ground level (No Floating AI or Players).
</li>
<br />
<li>
• There must be excess JIP slots (Extra riflemen).
</li>
<br />
<li>
• AI placed in and around buildings/fortifications should be garrisoned using TMF Garrison module, CBA defend
module or manually.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• AI units can be forced to be stationary by entering <b>“this disableAI ‘PATH’”;</b> in object init. (
<a href="https://pastebin.com/pmvB2nzw">https://pastebin.com/pmvB2nzw</a>)
</li>
<br />
<li>
• AI placed on patrols must have waypoints or be synced to a CBA patrol module
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Reserve AI must be placed out of sight of players and at an appropriate location
</li>
<br />
<li>
• AI should not be in a bunch of 1 man groups
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Hostage AI must be set as captive in ACE unit settings.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• If tanks are in the mission, the strength of standard infantry launchers must be kept in mind. Standard
infantry should not be equipped with HAT equipment.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Likewise, player vics (Mike/Gambler) should not be killable in 1 hit by enemy fireteam level AT
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Assets</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
• DLC assets / Weapons should only be given to a handful of slots and the slots should include the name of the
dlc required in the lobby.
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- TMF Autotest throws warnings for DLC usage.
</li>
<br />
</ul>
</li>
<li>
• Vehicle inventories should be clear of default items or have relevant equipment for missions. TMF Vic Gear is
still unreliable, make sure it is not being used
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Supplies such as ammo must fit the given weapon
</li>
<br />
<li>
• If you are utilizing any Refuel, Repair, Rearm (RRR) vehicles/assets, please ensure their respective ACE Settings
are set up. Some vehicles retrieve these attributes automatically, but double check to be sure.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Little Birds should use the MELB variant (higher quality)
</li>
<br />
<li>
• If there is enemy armour, ensure player equipment is capable and or reliable, and that they have adequate
quantities of it.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Players must be able to destroy enemy armour
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- Eg. If the enemy has T-72s, give the players ATGMs like Javelins or Hellfires
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Intel</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
• Map markers must be concise and not excessive. Objective markers must not be black (should not blend in
with player markers).
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Briefing must not contain typos.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Briefing needs to have clarity (simple objective bullet points)
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- Situation is the place to add lore and fluff to your narrative.
</li>
<br />
<li>
- Mission tab should be bullet points of the tasks to be completed by players, unless special
circumstances.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Briefing must be divided into appropriate sections
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Briefing must make use of all fields excluding special tasks and logistics, given that there is no
relevant information for those fields.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Logistics section should contain the amount of seats per transport vehicle (if any)
</li>
<br />
<li>
• The “TMF Spectator Objective” Module can be used to highlight points of interest (Hidden objectives,
hostages, etc) for spectators.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• If there is a chance of betrayal or there is an element of risk to the cooperation it must be observable
in at least a couple of locations. Either by outright stating it in mission task and one other place, or by
implying tension in some form in situation and one other place. This must also be specified in Admin for
tester awareness.
</li>
<br />
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Loadouts</h2>

<p><b>
When checking loadouts you should load into a multiplayer instance of the mission and use the loadout command
(#loadout)
</b></p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
• Loadouts must not contain anything related to ACRE.
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- All radios must be assigned in the TMF ACRE Menu.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>
• The “example loadout” in the TMF Mission Template should not be deleted or edited.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• New loadouts can be added by duplicating and renaming this file, and adding a new file reference in the
description.ext.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Avoid using magnified optics unless by mission design and only for special roles. Anything 1x-2x is
acceptable for a general rifleman.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• If night mission ensure loadouts have map flashlight (unless by mission design)
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Night missions should provide sufficient illumination or NVGs (mortar, flashlights, hand flares) and their

</li>
<br />
<li>
- All units must include the <b>MEDICAL_R</b> macro in <b>items[]</b> for basic medical equipment
</li>
<br />
<li>
- Combat Life Savers must include the <b>MEDICAL_CLS</b> macro in <b>backpackItems[]</b> for specialist

</li>
<br />
<li>
• When adding multiple of the same item, <b>LIST_n(x)</b> macros must be used
</li>
<br />
<li>
• A CLS is a rifleman first, medic later. Squad medics should always have a greater amount of medical
supplies.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• FAC loadout has coloured smokes, both hand and GL (red for enemy, green for friendly, purple for landing
zones)
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- Minimum of 6 of each color

</li>
<br />
<li>
• Radios are correctly set and frequencies allocated if used via TMF ACRE menu
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Map markers in TMF Orbat settings are in proper squad hierarchy
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Pilots should have high quality night vision.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Vehicle crew must have backpacks for toolkits
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Pilots and vehicle crew must have toolkits (either on person or in vehicle).
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- Backpacks are required if toolkits are provided.
</li>
<br />
<li>
- The amount of toolkits can be changed at the Mission Makers discretion.
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<li>

</li>
<br />
<li>
• If a nighttime mission or expected to be, all elements including MG’s, to be equipped with flash hiders or
suppressors unless specified not to by mission design.
</li>
<br />
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Mechanics</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
• Expected amount of passengers can load into the given transport vehicle(s) without many extra vehicles.
Excluding vehicles with dedicated crew, convoys must not exceed 3 vehicles per squad.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Sling loaded assets must be able to be sling loaded
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Triggers must work as intended and be double checked for locality
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- For server-only triggers ensure “server only” is checked
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Scripted mechanics must work as intended. Performance must be kept in mind.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• If MicroDAGR’s are included in the loadout; Consider also adding GPS terminal - Whilst MicroDAGR’s are
useful for the odd specialist role and non-inclusion of player unit markers, GPS are often better in a HUD
sense and adds map markers.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Be mindful of editor placed objects for performance reasons
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- Compositions are great indicators of performance issues
</li>
<br />
<li>
- Disable simulation on objects that will not be moved
</li>
<br />
<li>
- When testing be mindful of locked layers. These can be hiding extraneous
objects.
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<li>
• Weather and time of day should be interesting
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- We don’t want every mission to be clear day or night. If possible, make time
of day logical to the mission in question.
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<li>
• Moon phases can be used to adjust light levels in night missions. These
settings can be found and the date and time settings for the mission.
</li>
<br />
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Misc</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
• Weather and time of day should be interesting
</li>
<br />
<li>
• There must not be any land mines that are capable of instantly killing player infantry without adequate
warnings about location.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• An interesting banner image and map screenshot must be uploaded to ARCHUB
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Mission must not be overly large, and must be reasonably concluded in the respective time limits.
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- Cooperative missions must not exceed 2 hours (including safestart).
</li>
<br />
<li>
- Adversarial missions must not exceed 1 hour (including safestart).
</li>
<br />
<li>
- Objectives should be unique and precise (EX: capture the command post, kill the spy)
</li>
<br />
<li>
- Clearing a town is not a suitable mission objective, it is better left as a byproduct of player
strategy/tactics
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Think of the mission as a player and if you see something that needs testing, test it
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Imagine possible plans the players might choose for attack/defence and ensure
mission still functions with those plans in mind
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Mission .pbo must match standard naming convention to avoid being rejected by
ARCHUB
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- <b>ARC_</b>[<b>COOP</b> | <b>TVT</b> | <b>ADE</b>]<b>_MissionName_Author</b>
</li>
<br />
<li>
- Please use Pascal Case for the mission name (capitalize every word)
</li>
<br />
<li>
- Do not use spaces or special characters in your mission file name
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Remember to use in editor comments or Admin briefing to explain certain
aspects or objectives.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Missions exported from eden editor can be find in your Arma 3 folder
<ul>
<br />
<li>
- example: <b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3\MPMissions</b>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Missions uploaded to ARCHUB should be ready for play testing.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• After uploading your mission, leave a note on the hub briefly explaining the
mission and your expectations. Or use Admin Brief (admin.sqf)
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Missions must have a Zeus running them, even if the mission is autonomous.
</li>
<br />
<li>
• Do not Zeus from a JIP unit, use either the game master slot or create a
specific Zeus unit with game master tag.
</li>
<br />
</ul>
</p>
